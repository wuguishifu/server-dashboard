# Server Dashboard

This project is for my homelab so I can better manage all of my apps!

## Todo

### backend

- [ ] add user credential file generator so you can add users at startup
- [ ] change location of dbs to /data/* so they can be saved on the host file system (docker-compose)

### frontend

- [ ] add a user dashboard that lets the admins (specified in credential file) add/delete/update user accounts
